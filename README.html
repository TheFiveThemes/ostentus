<p>If You Got It, Flaut It!</p>

<p>Ostentus is a Portfolio WordPress theme named after the latin word for Display. It was created for visual artists looking to showcase their work. It uses Jetpack&#8217;s portfolio custom content type to make managing the portfolio entries easier and separate from the blog and page functionalities of WordPress.</p>

<p>Designed and developed originally by <a href="http://hugobaeta.com">Hugo Baeta</a> as part of <a href="http://thefivethemes.com/themes/ostentus">The Five Themes</a></p>

<p>Published under the GNU General Public License v2 or later - This theme, like WordPress, is licensed under the GPL. Use it to make something cool, have fun, and share what you&#8217;ve learned with others.</p>

<p>Development is done in this github repo. If you find a bug or want to make a request for a feature, you can create an issue, or make a pull request of your patch to the theme. Eventually the theme page on The Five Themes website will display the contributors to each theme.</p>

<p>To compile the theme&#8217;s Sass, there are two options:
- Use Grunt, all you have to do is a quick <code>npm install</code> on the project root in terminal, and then just run <code>grunt</code> to start watching for changes to the Sass files.
- Uee <a href="https://incident57.com/codekit/">Codekit</a>, there&#8217;s a config file included.</p>
