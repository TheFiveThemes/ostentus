#Ostentus WordPress Theme
If You Got It, Flaut It!

Ostentus is a Portfolio WordPress theme named after the latin word for Display. It was created for visual artists looking to showcase their work. It uses Jetpack's portfolio custom content type to make managing the portfolio entries easier and separate from the blog and page functionalities of WordPress.

Designed and developed originally by [Hugo Baeta](http://hugobaeta.com) as part of [The Five Themes](http://thefivethemes.com/themes/ostentus)

Published under the GNU General Public License v2 or later - This theme, like WordPress, is licensed under the GPL. Use it to make something cool, have fun, and share what you've learned with others.

##Development of the theme:

Development is done in this github repo. If you find a bug or want to make a request for a feature, you can create an issue, or make a pull request of your patch to the theme. Eventually the theme page on The Five Themes website will display the contributors to each theme.

To compile the theme's Sass, there are two options:
- Use Grunt, all you have to do is a quick `npm install` on the project root in terminal, and then just run `grunt` to start watching for changes to the Sass files. 
- Uee [Codekit](https://incident57.com/codekit/), there's a config file included.
